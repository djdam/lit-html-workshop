    /**
     * Assignment:
     * This is a free format assignment. At ING we are building the ing-web library, which is based on lit-html.
     * Check out the library here: https://gitlab.ing.net/TheGuideComponents/ing-web and here: https://web.developer.ing.net/projects/ing-web
     * Experiment with using it. For example:
     * - Replace the components from the assignments with components from ing-web
     * - Implement ing-web's CSS system
     * - Use ing-web's ajax system for fetching data
     *
     * This assignment cannot be completed inside plnkr. You will need to install your dependencies locally.
     *
     * Check out the README.md for reference documentation
